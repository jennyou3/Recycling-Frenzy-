Project Description: The name of the term project is Recycling Frenzy. The game revolves around recycling properly and placing trash items in their respective bins, while navigating through a maze. There will also be a robo-dog, Sparky, that you can call on to help collect trash for you. Note that you will appear as a light purple circle and Sparky is neon pink. 

How to run the project: run the file called “term project code.py” (my project doesn’t use data/source files). I’m also not using any libraries that need to be installed and I do not have any shortcut commands that exist.
